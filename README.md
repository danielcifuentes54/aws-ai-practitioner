## Fundamentals of AI and ML

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performin tasks that typically require human intelligence.

--> General Intelligence Simulations

1. Visual Percepcion
2. Speech Recognition
3. Decision making
4. Language Translation

#### Narrow AI

AI desgined for specific tasks , like virtual assistants 

#### General AI

Theoretical AI with human-like reasoning across diverse domains


### Machine Learning (ML)

ML involves using algorithms and statiscal models to allow computers to perform tasks by learning from data rather than following explicit instructions

--> Learning from data patterns

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model and solve more complex problems

--> Complex Patterns Recognition

### Inferencing 

Inferecing is the process in which AI models make predictions or decisions using new data, types:

* Real Time Inferecing (chatbots, fraud detection, autonomous driving systems)
  * SageMaker provide real time endpoints for scalable and low latency processing
* Batch Inferecing (Sentiment analysis on social media post collected over a day)
  * SageMaker transforms jobs for applying models to datasets in AmazonS3

### Data Types

Data Types refer to the various forms in which data can be represented and processed by AI models. These include numerical, categorical, and unstrcutured data

#### Categorical Data

Categorical data refers to information that can be divied into categories or groups

#### Types

* Numerical Data
* Raw Text Data (unstructured data)
* Image Data
* Audio Data (time series data)

#### Labeled vs Unlabeled

Labeled data contains both the input data and the corresponding output (target variable), while unlabeled data has only the input whithout the expected output

* Labeled Data (used it in supervised learning)
* unlabeled Data (used it in unsupervised learning)

#### Imbalanced Data 

Imbalanced data refers to datasets where on class (in classifications problems), has significantly more examples than the other(s). This can result in biased models that favor the dominant class.
