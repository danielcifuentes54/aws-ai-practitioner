Repository to present to the AWS Medellin group relevant information to ace the AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification

## Fundamentals of AI and ML

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performin tasks that typically require human intelligence.

--> General Intelligence Simulations

1. Visual Percepcion
2. Speech Recognition
3. Decision making
4. Language Translation

#### Narrow AI

AI desgined for specific tasks , like virtual assistants 

#### General AI

Theoretical AI with human-like reasoning across diverse domains


### Machine Learning (ML)

ML involves using algorithms and statiscal models to allow computers to perform tasks by learning from data rather than following explicit instructions

--> Learning from data patterns

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model and solve more complex problems

--> Complex Patterns Recognition

### Inferencing 

Inferecing is the process in which AI models make predictions or decisions using new data, types:

* Real Time Inferecing (chatbots, fraud detection, autonomous driving systems)
  * SageMaker provide real time endpoints for scalable and low latency processing
* Batch Inferecing (Sentiment analysis on social media post collected over a day)
  * SageMaker transforms jobs for applying models to datasets in AmazonS3
