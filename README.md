## Fundamentals of AI and ML

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performin tasks that typically require human intelligence.

--> General Intelligence Simulations

1. Visual Percepcion
2. Speech Recognition
3. Decision making
4. Language Translation

#### Narrow AI

AI desgined for specific tasks , like virtual assistants 

#### General AI

Theoretical AI with human-like reasoning across diverse domains


### Machine Learning (ML)

ML involves using algorithms and statiscal models to allow computers to perform tasks by learning from data rather than following explicit instructions

--> Learning from data patterns

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model and solve more complex problems

--> Complex Patterns Recognition

### Inferencing 

Inferecing is the process in which AI models make predictions or decisions using new data, types:

* Real Time Inferecing (chatbots, fraud detection, autonomous driving systems)
  * SageMaker provide real time endpoints for scalable and low latency processing
* Batch Inferecing (Sentiment analysis on social media post collected over a day)
  * SageMaker transforms jobs for applying models to datasets in AmazonS3

### Data Types

Data Types refer to the various forms in which data can be represented and processed by AI models. These include numerical, categorical, and unstrcutured data

#### Categorical Data

Categorical data refers to information that can be divied into categories or groups

#### Types

* Numerical Data
* Raw Text Data (unstructured data)
* Image Data
* Audio Data (time series data)

#### Labeled vs Unlabeled

Labeled data contains both the input data and the corresponding output (target variable), while unlabeled data has only the input whithout the expected output

* Labeled Data (used it in supervised learning)
* unlabeled Data (used it in unsupervised learning)

#### Imbalanced Data 

Imbalanced data refers to datasets where on class (in classifications problems), has significantly more examples than the other(s). This can result in biased models that favor the dominant class.

* ROC-AUC: A performance metric to help to mitigate imbalanced data

#### Big Data

Still relevant to manage large and complex datasets, to use it then in training, some AWS that can help with big data:

* Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)
* Amazon Glue
* Amazon SageMaker

#### Data Type for AI Models

1. Decision Trees: Structured Data
2. CNNs: Unstructured Data
3. RNNs: Time-Series Data

### Supervised, Unserpervised and Reinforcement Learning

* Supervised: Models learns from labeled data, e.g: predictions stock market
* Unservised: Finding patterns in unlabeled data, e.g: Identifying hidden customer segments based on purchasing behavior
* Reinforcement Learning: Models learns trough try and error by receiving rewards or penalties e.g: AlphaGo, Chess

### AI Limitations

* High costs
* Lack of Interpretability

### ML Development Lifecycle

Machine learning models are dynamic and require continous updates and retraining 

0. Business Goal Identification
1. Data Collection
  - 1.1 Data Preprocessing
  - 1.2 Data Augmentation
  - AWS Services: AWS S3, AWS Glue
2. Training
  - 2.1 Hyperparameter Tuning
  - 2.2 Evaluating Model Performances (Accuracy, precision, Recall, F1 score)
  - AWS Services: Amazon SageMaker
3. Deployment (Real Time, Batch)
  - AWS Services: Amazon SageMaker, Lambda, Amazon EMR
4. Monitoring
  - AWS Services: Amazon SageMaker, CloudWatch

### MLOps Concepts

* Automate ML deployment, monitoring and updates
* Uses CI/CD for continouos model delivery
* For the creation of MLOps pipelines you can use
  * Amazon SageMaker
    - Amazon SageMaker Pipelines
    - Version Control
    - Automating Model Training and Deployment 
    - Monitoring and Retraining Models (Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor)
    - Compliance and Auditability
    - Improving Model Quality (Amazon SageMaker Clarify)
  * Apache Airflow
* Model Performance Metrics

| Metric                        | What It Minimizes                          | Ideal When...                                                        |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Precision**                 | False Positives                           | Being overly cautious about positive predictions is acceptable.      |
| **Recall**                    | False Negatives                           | Missing true positives is highly undesirable.                        |
| **F1 Score**                  | Trade-off between FP/FN                   | A balance of precision and recall is required.                       |
| **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**| Misclassification across thresholds for binary classification | Evaluating the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes across all decision thresholds. |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  | Squared differences between actual and predicted values | Continuous predictions where large errors are penalized more. |
| **Business Metrics**          | Business-specific goals (e.g., revenue, cost savings, churn rate) | Evaluating the modelâ€™s direct impact on business outcomes. |
